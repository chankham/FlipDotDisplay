          <h1 class="page-title">About Us</h1>
          <p> We are team <span class="hightlight"> Smoke and Mirrors </span> from the University of Texas at Arlington. For our senior design project,
           we chose to construct  a flipdot display. The recreation of an old display technology, such as the flipdot display,
           is a valuable vehicle for learning design, decision making, and problem solving.
           We revived a retro display technology to create holiday display with modern additions that would allow for other students to interact with it</p>

          <p>The individual panels of the our display were constructed from a lightweight wood with motors to control each individual "pixel."
            Each disc on the display is made from matboard, a thick paper often used for mounting artwork. Each individual square can show two different colors, black and white.
            Three panels are controlled by a single microcontroller that determines which color each pixel should be. For our project, we employed Arduino Nanos. The Raspberry Pi hosts
            our server for our website. The website takes user inputs, transmits it to our server, which translates the information into packets that our microcontrollers can understand.
          </p>
          <p>The majority of the components of our flipdot display were constructed scratch. The only exception to this were the Arduinos, the Raspberry Pi, and the various integrated circuits used in board controller.

          <h3>Our Goal</h3>
          <p>Our aim is to re-introduce the flipdot display to people who may have forgotten it. Another goal of this project is to compete with various departments
            at the University of Texas at Arlington's holiday decoration contest. If you are interested in our project and
            want to support what we do, you can cast your vote for Computer Science Department this year.
          </br>
            Please come and demo
            our project this coming holiday. Remember to bring your phone with you to interact with the display.
